During the Great Depression in the United States, as homes and villages disappeared and people continued to change the map, China is undergoing **urbanization** today. In the past decade alone, the continuous urban **contraction** has reduced the population of an urban area in eastern China by nearly 10%, as young people are attracted by the better living and working conditions of surrounding large cities. I was driven by a sense of urgency and wanted to capture these places before they became memories. Maybe the city touches our memories of **inadvertent** **closure**, accustomed to accepting that everything will soon disappear.

China is developing rapidly, but at the same time paying painful price for its **brutal** growth: **accelerating** urbanization process has brought **inevitable** environmental degradation and social problems. Therefore, the human-nature relationship catches great attention. This city locates in a **coastal** province in Eastern China. It is geographically small and economically uncompetitive. It is falling behind due to various problems. For the young, like me, to stay or to seek their fortune **elsewhere** has always been a touch choice. Humans have been trying hard to alter the nature according to our own wishes. I take myself as a tracker following this process, who records **subtle** traces before they disappear forever. However, everything seems to hit limits in reality.

Desperately **intoxicated**. Waking from a dream, in the face of reality—or continuing to sink. All around China, the young generation is avoiding the question of how to live and instead finding themselves **glued** to the nearest internet cafe. They are not interested in learning or growing themselves—only with the existence of their virtual selves.

My work is made in a small city that shows the country’s realistic daily life.Even some excellent young people from this area—longing for the opportunities of big city life—will find themselves blocked in their careers and thus rooted to this small town. Escapism, then, becomes an obvious route.

Escapism—a particularly troublesome position to take in China, a country in which family life is so strong and binding. While not obvious from the pictures themselves, this social context helps us understand the invisible emotional **poignancy** of these alienated individuals.

Dog fighting is a popular Chinese **gambling** game. Gambling in China is strictly prohibited.

Innocent dogs. Died in the arena is the only thing they can do after being selected the fighting dog. No escape, no betrayal, only eternal loyalty, until death. This is the fate of life, the fate of the dog.

Dog **servility**, is a very bad evil psychology, never a dog, because there are different masters, you can practice their own kind, to the point of extreme cruelty. It wanted to co-exist with the master’s life, but found that because there are different masters, you can practice their own kind, to the point of extreme cruelty.This kind of servility, regardless of race.
